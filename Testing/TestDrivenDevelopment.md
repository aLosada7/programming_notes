# Test Driven Development

Write test before writing code.

More eficient and better code.

Thinking from the client perspective instead of the implementation one.

You will know the state of your code at any time.. Positive reinforcements along the way!

**IMPORTANT TDD PRINCIPLE: For TDD we always want red tests before they pass**

## Phases

* **RED** - Write a failing test for a given use case
* **GREEN** - Write the code to make the failing test pass. then, you have make it green.
* **BLUE** - Refactor. After implementing the new code, you need to refactor your code without changing its behaviour. This step must be done always.
