# ngStyle & ngClass

**ngStyle & ngClass** are the most used angular core directives, very useful for styling components.

**ngClass** allows you to pass an array or a string of CSS classes, or even a configuration object.

Meanwhile, **ngStyle** allow you to do such things as adding embedded styles to your template.

Remember that both directives allow you to use one-way binding mechanism, which helps you to manage your styles dynamically.
