# Double Linked List

Set of sequentially linked records (nodes). Two directions, so double pointer (next and previous). **NOT** ordered

After and before beginning and ending nodes, respectively, **NULL**

### Example

null ← 1 ←→ 14 ←→ 6 → null

> Time Complexity

Access → O(n)

Search → O(n)

Insertion → O(n)

Deletion → O(n)

> Space Complexity

O(n)
