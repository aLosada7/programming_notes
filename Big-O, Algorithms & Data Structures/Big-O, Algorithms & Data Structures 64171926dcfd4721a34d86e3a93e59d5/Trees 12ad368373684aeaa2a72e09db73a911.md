# Trees

Can be extrapolated for example to a representation of architecture, considering the weight of the edges as the time data needs to travel from one service to another

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**

One or two childs and one parent. Keys in sorted order. Balanced

> Time Complexity

Access → O(log(n))

Search →  O(log(n))

Insertion →  O(log(n))

Deletion →  O(log(n))

> Space Complexity

O(n)

*If unbalanced, O(n), because we have to loop through every single node
