# F.I.R.S.T.

Rules for clean testing

- **Fast (Rapidez)** - Test must be fast. If not, they won't be executed frequently
- **Isolated (Independencia)** - Tests must not have any order-of-run dependency. No dependency between tests or execution order
- **Repeatable (Repetición)** - Run repeatedly without intervention, or without importance of the environment (production, pre-production)
- **Self-Validating (Validación automática**) - Boolean result (success or failure). No lectures, comparations, or other stuff to check if the test result was satisfactory or not
- **Timely (Puntualidad)** - Tests are written at right time, before production code make them pass. Do not design product code which cannot be checked
