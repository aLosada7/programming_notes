# Decorator

Add behavior to an existing object during run-time

Higher-order components

Composition allows you to encapsulate custom behavior inside different classes and then use the pattern to create new instances of those classes by passing the original object to their constructor

```tsx
abstract class Animal {

    abstract move(): void
}

abstract class SuperDecorator extends Animal {
    protected comp: Animal
    
    constructor(decoratedAnimal: Animal) {
        super()
        this.comp = decoratedAnimal
    }
    
    abstract move(): void
}

class Dog extends Animal {

    public move():void {
        console.log("Moving the dog...")
    }
}

class SuperAnimal extends SuperDecorator {

    public move():void {
        console.log("Starts flying...")
        this.comp.move()
        console.log("Landing...")
    }
}

class SwimmingAnimal extends SuperDecorator {

    public move():void {
        console.log("Jumps into the water...")
        this.comp.move()
    }
}

const dog = new Dog()

console.log("--- Non-decorated attempt: ")
dog.move()

console.log("--- Flying decorator --- ")
const superDog =  new SuperAnimal(dog)
superDog.move()

console.log("--- Now let's go swimming --- ")
const swimmingDog =  new SwimmingAnimal(dog)
swimmingDog.move()
```

*SuperAnimal* and *SwimmingAnimal* are the actual decorators (they add extra behavior)
