# My programming notes

Hey.

I hope you find useful my programming notes, code snipets and concepts. I take my personal notes on Notion, so I update them here from time to time. 

I have also added different coding exercises in case they can be helpful not only for me. I am working on including exercises with tests, since this should be one of the foundations of your clean and maintainable code.

PD: For any suggestions, collaborations or doubts, do not hesitate to contact me  :)
