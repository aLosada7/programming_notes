# My programming notes

Hey.

I hope you find useful my programming notes, code snippets and concepts. I take my personal notes on Notion (that's why you will see strange numbers after the folder's name), so I update them here from time to time. The notes are exported in Markdown, which makes them easier to be read in Github.

I have also added different coding exercises in case they can be helpful not only for me. I have added and I am working on including exercises with tests, since this should be one of the foundations of your clean and maintainable code.

PD: For any suggestions, collaborations or doubts, do not hesitate to contact me  :)
